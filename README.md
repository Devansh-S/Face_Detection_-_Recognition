# Face_Recognition

Face recognition using deep neural networks
This model is capable of on relatively low powered devices and it can be useful for various applicaions like automatic attendance marking and people counting and recognization.

The complete model is made up of two the first one is a face detection algorithm and the second one is a deep neural network for classification of faces.
